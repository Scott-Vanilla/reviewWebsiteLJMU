Professor Layton and the Curious Village is not your usual handheld game. This original title lets you know right from the start just how different a DS experience is going to be. The game opens with one of the most impressive introduction animations seen on the Nintendo DS, establishing its characters and European-influenced art style extremely well in the first five minutes. Even though the designers back the presentation down a bit after the initial build-up, the game continues strong as a fun and unique handheld adventure.

The strange little town of St. Mystere loves puzzles. Loves them. The citizens can't strike up a single conversation without challenging the person they're chatting with to solve a brain teaser. Even when there's murder afoot, no one can seem to take their mind off of some challenging headscratchers. Find a penny on the ground, solve a puzzle about pennies. Look at a clock, learn a clock-related puzzle. See a cat licking himself, hey, there's a cat-licking puzzle. No…not really. But you get my point.

Professor Layton and the Curious Village is, essentially, a huge assortment of textbook puzzle games strung together by an old-school point-and-click adventure. There's a story -- one about a mysterious will and a golden apple treasure -- that evolves into a murder mystery that Professor Layton has a desire to solve. But to unfold the story and uncover the clues, Layton and his apprentice must win at all sorts of puzzles that are thrown at them.

Some puzzles are required to solve before you can move on. Others are optional. Many are hidden, only revealed by poking around the environments instead of simply following the script and hopping from location to location to finish the adventure. If a puzzle's giving you a bit of a problem, you can spend earned Hint Tokens to uncover one of each puzzle's three hints, and these Hint Tokens are earned exactly the same way as the way you uncover the hidden puzzles: by poking around the environments.

Puzzles range in difficulty, from the absolute obvious to the downright devious. Remember Die Hard with a Vengeance? You'll find a ton of variations of the puzzles that Jeremy Irons dishes out to Bruce Willis, including that "pour the liquid" challenge…but this time it's not to disarm any bombs. Many puzzles really need to be calculated, but others are trick questions. And sometimes these trick questions are simple to spot: if the script is throwing several numbers at you, you can pretty much guarantee that these numbers are just to throw you off and the answer is a lot simpler than the text is letting on.
