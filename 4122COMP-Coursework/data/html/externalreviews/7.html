Final Fantasy: Type-0 had me in tears after watching a chocobo bleed to death in the opening scene, and for the next 40 hours I would experience everything from sadness to disbelief as the thin but reverent story unfolded. During that same time, the zippy action-based combat made running around the world of Orience a lively experience, though viewed through an occasionally obstinate camera. Type-0 has a strange dichotomy of action and emotion, but it comes together to create a roleplaying game that works on multiple levels.
Everything in Type-0 is tied to war, which makes for some intriguing presentation of the usual Final Fantasy features. Magic comes in the form of fire bombs, lightning missiles, and ice bullets, while the story progresses via military campaigns that involve liberating towns, defending bases, and invading cities. Even chocobos are bred for war; I liked that by capturing birds in the wild and correctly breeding them, you can hatch combat-ready chocobos that help fight in sorties, or can race across the world map to quickly arrive at a destination.

The tale of an elite group of young cadets fighting an aggressive military empire serves as a reminder that it’s the young who die in war, and who are the first to be forgotten. Class Zero’s emotional struggles – like watching friends die on the battlefield and then feeling guilty because they’re unable to remember them, is incredibly moving. Unfortunately, the cringe-worthy voice acting in the English-language version sometimes distracted from the solemnity, especially when the class loudmouth Nine kept adding “yo” and “hey” after every bloody sentence. Luckily, there are humorous moments sprinkled in to lighten the mood and keep the story from getting too dark; I laughed out loud when a saucy cadet named Carla sweet-talked a military instructor, then turned around to brag about her manipulation skills.

Campaigns that involve running through city streets or infiltrating fortresses were pretty fun, but I had a hard time with the real-time strategy missions that popped up here and there. I nearly rage quit one operation because the stubborn camera and clunky controls made it hard for me to move around the battlefield. These annoying mechanical issues were inherited from the original PSP version of Type-0 (which was released exclusively in Japan back in 2011), along with a few other noticeable limitations: NPCs have blocky faces, wall textures are blurred and jaggy, and dungeons and towns are little more than long, monochromatic corridors. I was so bored by most environments that I stopped caring about them halfway through the story.

Type-0’s gritty tone, fast-paced action, and strategic approach to time management is a welcome change of pace from the usual Final Fantasy experience. Though an exasperating camera and clunky mission controls sometimes dampened my fun, I enjoyed meeting the Class Zero cadets and guiding them through battle. There’s definitely no other class quite like them.
