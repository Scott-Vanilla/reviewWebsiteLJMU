	Fire Emblem as a franchise has always had mature and well-developed plotlines; 
	however, none come close to the epic storytelling displayed in Radiant Dawn 
	(the sequel to Fire Emblem Path of Radiance). The plot follows multiple groups of 
	character fighting from multiple countries (all are playable). The main story 
	revolves around the liberation of Dein from the Bengion Empire, a concurrent Civil 
	war in the country of Crimea, the war between the Bengion Empire and the Laguz Sub-Human Tribes 
	(including humans that can transform into ravens, tigers, hawks and angels), and 
	lastly the awakening of a dark god. The story seems impossible to follow but the 
	storytelling and concept layout is incredibly detailed yet simple to comprehend. 
	The graphics and length of the game itself are exceptional for a Nintendo Wii game of its time.
