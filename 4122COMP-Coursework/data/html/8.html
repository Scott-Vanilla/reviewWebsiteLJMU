	Pokémon Sun is the new frontier for the Pokémon franchise with
	 a new and exciting gameplay, characters and Pokémon. The new reigon
	  of Alola does away with the gym leader and Pokémon Gyms, instead 
	  opting for Island Challenges which include battles as well as puzzles 
	  for the player to solve adding a new element to the game. Alola also adds 
	  a new generation of Pokémon to the game universe along with Alola forms and 
	  Z moves. Although the Z moves fell somewhat short; the new Alola form have quickly 
	  become a fan favorite. The game follows you, a new trainer to alola, 
	  taking on the island trials and stopping team skull from their evil master
	   plan along the way. Definatley worth playing, newcomers and 
	   Pokémon fans alike.
