	Final Fantasy XV (FFXV) follows the story of Prince Noctis and his three 
	friends as they go on a road-trip to take Noctis to his wedding so that he can marry 
	Lady Lunafreya and end the war that has plagued his nation for decades. 
	The game is mainly focused around the four main characters, Noctis, Gladiolus, Ignis, and Prompto. 
	These characters seem awkward initially and they are hard to like. However, 
	after spending time with them and being a part of their growth through their 
	adventures you grow attached to them. By the end of the story you are in tears that 
	the journey must end. The world is very familiar but unusual at the same time as it 
	leans more towards a modern world whereas all the prior games have been more magical, 
	or steampunk based, but the game still has the series staple fantasy setting that will 
	always appear and remind you that you are in a different world. In short FFXV is an adventure 
	that at first may seem strange to both newcomers and long-time fans of the series but if you 
	play until after the tutorial chapters you will find a world that you will fall in love 
	with and characters that you will laugh and cry alongside.
