	Type 0 branched out from the normal feel of a final fantasy game 
	with a team of 13 at your disposal. These Agito cadets are specialist trained 
	children who are soldiers for their country fighting for the independance of Rubrum. 
	The games main plot is somewhat confusing and can be boring in some places, and 
	the excessive amount of characters leads to minimal development throughout. 
	However the religous arc on which the story is based is a captivating new look 
	from the FF13 perspective.
