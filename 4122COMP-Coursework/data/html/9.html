	Fortnite Battle Royale is underwhelming and not worth the time to play. 
	With obvious parts taken from PUBG, it is difficult to appriciate that this 
	game has any originality at all! The whole game relies on the loot you 
	obtain and means that good players can be overlooked by bad luck. The 
	game has a single limited map which grows boring after multiple instances 
	of playing. In game purchases are pointless too and add no value to the game on the 
	whole, and is but another money grabbing scheme. Spend your money elsewhere!
