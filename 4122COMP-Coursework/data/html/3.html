	Pokemon has been a long running franchise of games with many 
	great successes and some failures; Sapphire is one of the success stories. 
	Sapphire follows you through the region of Hoenn, catching mystical creatures known as Pokemon. 
	You use these creatures to battle other trainers, gym leaders, the elite four, 
	and the mysterious team aqua and magma. The game however lacks originality as we are 
	familiar with the same general direction of the franchise, however the game still proves 
	to have a place in Pokemon fans hearts, with many of them putting it in their top 3 Pokemon games.
