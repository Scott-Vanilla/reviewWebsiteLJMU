	The story of FFIV starts with young Dark Knight Cecil Harvey in the town of Baron, 
	who has been raised by the King of Baron from birth. The game follows Cecil and his 
	friends including Rosa Joanna Farrell, Rhydia, Kain Highwind, and other companions, 
	on their quest to stop the four elemental archfiends from domination of Earth. 
	FFIV takes anywhere from 35-80 hours to complete depending on the player and has a 
	captivating storyline throughout. The re-release of the game in 3D on the Nintendo DS showed 
	a more live story with the higher quality graphics and character designs. The difficulty of the 
	game can sometimes prove too much for younger players with many tricky boss fights throughout 
	and a puzzling and vast map layout with the inclusion of the Overworld, Underworld and 
	Red Moon. However, overall the game is one that you are unable to put down!
